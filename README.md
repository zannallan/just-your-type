## Deliverables

The grades for this assignment are split over 3 different deliverables: text & sketches, code, design & rationale.

- **Text & sketches** — decide on the piece of text & plan every aspect of the website on paper: boxes, semantics, grids, type, modules, responsiveness—all screen sizes.
- **Code** — satisfy all of Markbot’s requirements—and submit using Markbot.
- **Design & rational** — apply sensible design choices, to compliment the text you’ve chosen—[and explain all your decisions](#rationale).

### Rationale

Part of the submission is to write a rationale for your design choices. *Submit your rationale as an Issue on GitHub, attached to the “Just your type” repository.*

1. Explain your chosen concept.
2. Why did you choose these typefaces?
3. Why did you choose this type scale?
4. Why did you choose these colours?
5. How did you effectively use grids & modular CSS?
6. What challenges did you overcome?
